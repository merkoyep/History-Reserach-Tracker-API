# ResearchBuddy

This application is my final project submission for both ACS2230 and ACS2330. It is both a backend API and a responsive front-end application.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is for students, academics, and researchers to be able to keep track of multiple sources and its associated citations. Eventually, this app could be expanded to generate citations and bibliographies for research papers and presentations.

## How to run

To run this application, run `npm start` in the frontend directory, and `node index.js` in the backend directory. Navigate to localhost:3001 in your browser and follow instructions to start.

## How to utilize the application

Sign up and login to the application, then utilize the navbar to the sources or citations tab to be able to add notes and data to your user database.
